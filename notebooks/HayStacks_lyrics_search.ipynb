He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise. In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise. He's chained forever to a world that's departed. It's not enough, it's not enough. His blood has frozen &amp; curdled with fright. His knees have trembled &amp; given way in the night. His hand has weakened at the moment of truth. His step has faltered. One world, one soul. Time pass, the river rolls. It's not enough it's not enough. His hand has faltered. .... .... ....... And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication. And silent replies that swirl invitation. Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea. A grim intimation of what is to be. There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night. And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight.
